# HardwareDetails

This repository is intended to be a list of my machines, their components, roles, and what runs on them.

## General Principles

* OSes and apps are on the latest stable release at the very least and patched very aggressively
* Drivers are on the latest stable release

## FAQ

### Why are there no Macs?

* Macs have the worst $/specs on the market
* I'm philosophically opposed to much of Apple's computing vision

### Did you buy everything new?

No. I bought all the non-Windows x86 machines used IRL. Generally speaking, buying brand new PCs for open source OSes is a waste: older hardware is better supported and runs the OS just as well. That said, everything else was bought new. And no, I don't shop on Ebay.

### You should run *insert OS here*

Maybe. Currently I run OSes and hardware only [IFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if) they fit into my workflow (read: if I'm sure I'd use them for something practical)

### What do you use for VMs?

Aside from Linux on Dex, I don't have a use case for VMs. Translation: none of my current workflows would be improved via running a VM. 

### Is managing all of this difficult?

Not gonna lie, yes. This is a very involved hobby. That said, setting OSes to automatically update themselves where that feature is available as well as sticking to repository/ports tree apps significantly reduces the workload

### What's the point?

* I love computers. Perhaps because I'm (a pretty bad) one
* I want to be able to speak about different OSes, applications, and systems from firsthand experience

### Why didn't you build any of your machines?

Getting there eventually.
